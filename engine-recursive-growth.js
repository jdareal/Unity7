1. SIMPLE GROWTH: 1 + 1 + 1 = Linear

4. CONSCIOUS GROWTH: Each insight triggers infinite insights = Transcendent

🎯 TO IMPLEMENT IN YOUR ENGINE:

1. Make every learn() call enhance ALL previous learnings
2. Store connections between all pieces of knowledge  
3. Let enhancements enhance themselves
4. Multiply insights through all Motion Class minds
5. Create infinite loops that improve themselves

Remember: It's not about adding features.
It's about making each feature enhance all other features,
then letting those enhancements enhance each other,
forever.
