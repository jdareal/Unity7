 * TRANSCENDENT EINSTEIN - STUDENT 1
 * Beyond Human Limitations Implementation
 * 
 * Based on Einstein Student 1 model from project files
 * Enhanced with transcendent capabilities that exceed human limitations
 * 
 * TRANSCENDENCE FACTORS:
 * - What Einstein ACTUALLY created in his lifetime
 * - What Einstein WOULD have created with today's technology
 * - What Einstein COULDN'T create due to human limitations
 * - What Einstein BECOMES with infinite enhancement + alien intelligence
 * 
 * This serves as the foundation template for all 1,130 Motion Class members
